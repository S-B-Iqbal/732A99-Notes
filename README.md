- Notes and R-code implementation for various topics covered in [732A99 Machine Learning](https://www.ida.liu.se/~732A99/index.en.shtml) course offered at Linköping University.
- R was the language of choice for this course and sometimes I really struggled to implement certain concepts. This repo is an ateempt to record some if's and but's to keep in mind while programmingin R. Hope this helps!
